Code Setup:

Client.py:
in this file i simulate sensor (motion sensor) the sensor will send to the server two tpy of data :

1. Motion 2. No Motion. 

Sensor configuration:
the sensor have tow functions the do_Get function and the motion_detection.

do_GET:
this funktions is responsible for getting the response from the server and read it and send back information to the server.
in the varibale data i read the response  and print it, the data which i get from the server. Than I send back information 
to the server through the funktion motion_detection. 

motion_detection:
in this function i create a loop, inside this loop i have send the lis which i made for the sensor motion list. than i 
have create a variable modified_data to get a random result from the motion list. and send this result back to the server with 
a post. I used time sleep to make a delay 5sec and than send back to the server if we have a movement or not. 

all this information we have will be send through the RPi and than from the RPi to the main server. 

The purpose of doing this:

what i think is, if i can simulate the sansor when the sensor send to the App that there is a movement, than the app will 
response with a ID for this movement and the time when the movement has been discovered. and send this information back to
the Client. than the Client send back to the Server that this ID is on this zone. 

Zones: 
zone 1 at the kiosk zone 
zone 2 at the pay zone
zone 3 Exit zone. 

tha server will send a diffrent events to the cilent according the zone. all that its just to make a test cases. that we 
can use them to test the system.
